# TikTok Script: "From Code to Container - My Docker Journey"

## Hook (0-3 seconds)
"POV: You just learned Docker and now everything needs to be containerized üòÇ"

## Problem Setup (3-8 seconds)
"Built this URL shortener app with Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Works perfectly on my machine... but what about production? ü§î"

## The Journey (8-20 seconds)
"Started with basic Docker containers, then realized I needed Nginx as a reverse proxy. Single port architecture? Check ‚úÖ Multi-stage builds? Check ‚úÖ Environment variables? Check ‚úÖ"

## The "Aha" Moment (20-30 seconds)
"The biggest lesson? Not every service needs Nginx! My backend stays lean with just Node.js, while the frontend container handles all the heavy lifting. Performance boost? 10x faster static file serving! üöÄ"

## Results (30-45 seconds)
"Now I have a production-ready app that can scale horizontally, with proper security, rate limiting, and zero CORS issues. Next step? Kubernetes! üí™"

## Call to Action (45-60 seconds)
